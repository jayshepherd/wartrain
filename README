Welcome to WarTrain!

The plan is for WarTrain to be a feature complete replacement front-end 
for Network Media Tank set-top boxes (http://www.networkedmediatank.com/).

The planned features include but are not limited to: 

- Dynamic Media Managers (aka jukeboxes*) for various media types.
- Web-based admin interface.
- Population of media metadata from various external sources
- Skinnable front-end


Due to the lack of a Rails stack on the NMT platform, you must run WarTrain on 
an external system with a Rails stack, and add it to the NMT as a Web Service.

== ROADMAP ==

0.1 - Movies
0.2 - TV
0.3 - MMA/Other 
0.4 - Music
0.5 - Photo
0.6 - Rails on NMT
0.7 - Database on NMT

* The NMT community commonly refer to replacement user-interfaces to manage 
  media as "jukeboxes".
